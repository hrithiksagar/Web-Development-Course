<!-- Semantic tags: makes meaning to browser and developer 
    like:
    <h1>  shows important text
    <h6>  shows less important text
    <nav> shows navigation info of webpage 
        
        but these tags doesnt tell anything about the content!! 
        <div> no meaning  - used for grouping and applying any function on it like css or js
        <span> no meaning - used similarly like div, but it is inline elments

        inline elements: elements takes same space as much as content is taking
        block lable:    horizontal space is occupied, example tags: address, article, header, footer, form, main, ul, ol, li, table, tfoot...\
