what is DOM?
Html will get converted to DOM when it is sent to server
- tree like structure
like this below tree:

                Parent

    Child       Child       Child

                Sibling

this will help to design, debug


this dom will go to computer memory
fetch CSS and HTML, like videos images javascrip
javascrip loads in the last 
Fetching:
- CSS --> Media --> javascrip
Load HTMl -> Parse HTMl -> Create DOM Tree -> Display
                \|/           /|\ - Attach style to DOM nodes
            Load CSS ->     Parse CSS
